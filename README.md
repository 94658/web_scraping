# Flask web scraping 

In this app, I used this site to scrape, which is offered by Digital Ocean's for web scraping : https://assets.digitalocean.com/articles/eng_python/beautiful-soup/mockturtle.html

# Web Scraping Process

 I used this python packages: 
 - **BeautifulSoup**
 - **Flask**
 - **jsonify**
 - **requests** 

 The process involves:

  + **Importing the python packages**
  + **Get HTML source via HTTP**
  + **Importing BeautifulSoup**
  + **Convert raw HTML to manageable object**
  + **Extract data from soup object**
  + **Importing scrape module into flask web script**
  + **Load data into web page**
